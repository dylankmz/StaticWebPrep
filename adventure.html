            <p>Finn is a teenaged human. He was roughly five feet ten tall at the show's debut, but sometime between
                "The
                Cooler" and "The Pajama War," he underwent a growth spurt and is currently very nearly as tall as
                Princess
                Bubblegum. He is missing several teeth due to his habit of biting trees and rocks among other things.
                Although
                his eyes typically lack detail and appear as small black dots, they are shown to have color in "The
                Enchiridion!" while Finn is undergoing Dark Magician's trials. His left eye is green while his right eye
                is
                blue, characteristic of the genetic condition heterochromia. However, as stated by lead character
                designer
                Andy
                Ristaino, "That was a special occasion. The heterochromatic effect was a byproduct of him being
                hypnotized
                by
                that guardian dude." He went on to confirm that both of Finn's eyes are blue</p>
